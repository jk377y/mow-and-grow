## ***STILL IN DEVELOPMENT***


## Description
This is a web application that I built for my son to schedule his clients for his lawn mower business. Nothing made me more proud than to be able to help him with his own ambitions. This a full stack application using React and MongoDB. It is basically a glorified TODO application but organizes his clients and their appointments chronologically.
